Design Patterns in Java
A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.

Now, a question will be arising in your mind what kind of specific problem? Let me explain by taking an example.

Problem Given:
Suppose you want to create a class for which only a single instance (or object) should be created and that single object can be used by all other classes.

Solution:
Singleton design pattern is the best solution of above specific problem. So, every design pattern has some specification or set of rules for solving the problems

But remember one-thing, design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems. That means, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation.
By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable. It is the most important part because java internally follows design patterns.
To become a professional software developer, you must know at least some popular solutions (i.e. design patterns) to the coding problems.
